# Supply_Chain_Health_Commodity_Shipment_PowerBi_Project

ðŸ”¶ Title : Supply Chain: Health Commodity Shipment Analysis

ðŸ”¶ Overview : The  project aimed to analyze and understand various aspects of the supply chain for health commodities. This included examining consumer countries, vendors, product groups, item brands, manufacturing sites, shipment modes, unit prices, pack prices, doses ordered, brands ordered, orders over time, and shipment punctuality.

ðŸ”¶ Insights:

1. Identified the total count of consumer countries, vendors, product groups, and item brands involved in the supply chain, providing insights into the diversity and scope of operations.

2. Determined the top five manufacturing sites based on shipment volumes, shedding light on key production hubs critical to the supply chain.

3. Analyzed the distribution of shipment modes, highlighting the percentage of each mode used in the supply chain, offering insights into the preferred logistics strategies.

4. Calculated the average unit price and per pack price, providing an understanding of pricing dynamics and cost structures within the supply chain.

5. Identified the top five doses and brands ordered, indicating the most in-demand products and brands within the supply chain.

6. Examined the total number of orders over time, identifying trends and patterns in demand and supply dynamics.

7. Evaluated shipment punctuality to determine the percentage of on-time and off-time deliveries, offering insights into supply chain efficiency and reliability.
